================================================
This is a Delay Tolerant Networking implementation on the Android platform.
This project based on bytawalla which based on DTN2.
This implementation is written in Java and highly inspired by the design of
DTN2 software version 2.6 developed in C++ by the DTN research group 
[http://www.dtnrg.org/wiki/Code].

Standards & Compatiblity
========================
This implementation followed the Bundle Protocol specification (RFC5050) and have been tested communicating 
with DTN2( Reference Implementation done by DTN Research Group). The TCP convergence layer is based on the Delay Tolerant Networking 
TCP Convergence Layer Protocol draft version 2. 

Official RFC5050 specification can be found at [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5050].

res/values   - The development parameters (strings.xml) stored here
bin/         - generated binary location which is suitable to run on the Android device or Emulator kept here 

Developer Guide
===============
  We used Eclispe with ADT plugin [http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/eclipse-adt.html] as a main development tool. 
As a result, continuing development with the tool is recommended but not mandatory.
